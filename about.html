      <p class="post-text">
        I am a female interested in motorsport and I do hope to see more
        diversity in the sport. My name is Stephanie and I’ve started watching
        Formula 1 in the middle of the 2021 season, however lately I’ve been
        following a lot of the technical things that you don’t necessarily go
        into as a fan.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        For me, I could say Formula 1 was a love at first sight, watching that
        first race definitely stood out to me, even though it was quite
        accidental. I can’t say I’ve been particularly leaning towards cars my
        whole life; it was quite a surprise to get into such a sport, but it
        definitely brought out the best in me and, of course, my appetite for
        cars and everything else that comes with it. After that first race, I
        watched a few series and movies about F1 and it eventually stuck with
        me. I am still going as strong as day 1 and I am planning on keeping it
        that way. I also like to keep an eye on support series like F2 and F3
        from time to time.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        I am quite new to the sport, but I’ve been really wanting to go deeper
        and find out more about what it might mean, what are the more unknown
        rules and most importantly, how the cars are built. In an industry so
        well developed, known as the pinnacle of motorsport, with the most
        advanced pieces of technology, you must be attracted to learn and find
        out more about its technical side or maybe even the engineering behind
        it all. I’m planning on going deeper into concepts that are quite rarely
        talked about, but at the same time learn new and fascinating things
        about the sport and its cars along the way.
